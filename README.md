SQL
This SQL code analyzes a restaurant's order data for a quarter, focusing on the date, time, items ordered, and their details (type, name, and price). The analysis aims to identify trends such as the least and most ordered items, high-spending orders, peak order times, and which cuisines might need more menu development. It examines item popularity, spending patterns, and ordering times to provide insights into the restaurant's performance and areas for improvement.
